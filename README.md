## Technical Notes
------
As part of my resolutions for 2018, I'm going to read more. And not just read, but read and take notes on the things I read. In my experience, when I write about the things that I read, it forces me to process them, which not only helps me find potential holes in my own understanding, but also makes things much harder to forget. Its easy to forget facts, like what the capital of Uganda is, or how to say canteloupe in French. Its much harder to forget understanding, like what a function does, or how a phone works. 

So this will be my central repository for note-taking on technical books (and potentially all educational reads, if the system works well), starting with a book on design patterns that I've been meaning to read for months. 

Here's to a happy and productive 2018!
